## 📡 Backend API Endpoints Required

Your backend should implement these endpoints:

### Meetup Endpoints
- `GET /api/meetup` - List all meetups (with optional filters)
- `GET /api/meetup/:id` - Get single meetup details
- `POST /api/meetup` - Create new meetup
- `PUT /api/meetup/:id` - Update meetup
- `DELETE /api/meetup/:id` - Delete meetup
- `POST /api/meetup/:id/join` - Join meetup
- `POST /api/meetup/:id/leave` - Leave meetup
- `GET /api/user/meetups` - Get user's hosted and joined meetups

### User Endpoints (existing)
- `PUT /api/user/profile` - Update user profile

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Backend Development**: Implement the meetup API endpoints listed above
2. **Testing**: Test all pages with real backend data
3. **Enhancements** (Optional):
   - Add chat/comments to meetup detail page
   - Implement edit meetup functionality
   - Add image uploads for meetups
   - Add notifications for meetup updates
   - Implement favorite sports selection
   - Add search history and saved searches
   - Implement real-time participant updates

## 🧪 Testing the Implementation

1. Start your dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Sign in with an existing account
3. You should automatically be redirected to `/dashboard`
4. Navigate through all pages using the navbar
5. Try creating a meetup
6. Browse and view meetup details

**Note:** Pages will work in the UI, but will show errors when trying to fetch data until the backend API endpoints are implemented.
